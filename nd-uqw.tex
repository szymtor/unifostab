\section{From nowhere denseness to uniform quasi-wideness}\label{sec:uqw}

In this section we prove \cref{thm:new-uqw}. 
% In the presentation we focus on proving the existential statement, and at the end we briefly argue how the proof can be turned into an algorithm with the promised running time.
We first recall some basic notions from graph theory. 

\paragraph*{Preliminaries.}
All graphs in this paper are finite, undirected and simple, that is, 
they do not have loops or parallel edges. Our notation is standard,
we refer to~\cite{diestel2012graph} for more background on 
graph theory. 
We write $V(G)$ for the vertex set of a graph $G$ and
$E(G)$ for its edge set. 
The {\em{distance}} between vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$, denoted $\dist_G(u,v)$, is the length of a shortest path between $u$ and $v$ in~$G$.
If there is no path between $u$ and $v$ in $G$, we put $\dist_G(u,v)=\infty$.
The {\em{(open) neighborhood}} of a vertex $u$, denoted $N(u)$, is the set of neighbors of $u$, excluding $u$ itself.
For a non-negative integer $r$, by $N_r[u]$ we denote the {\em{(closed) $r$-neighborhood}} of $u$ which comprises vertices at distance at most $r$ from $u$; note that $u$ is always contained in its closed $r$-neighborhood. The \emph{radius} of a graph $G$ is the least integer $r$ such that there is some vertex $v$ of $G$ with $N_r[v]=V(G)$.


A {\em{minor model}} of a graph $H$ in $G$ is a family $(I_u)_{u\in V(H)}$ of pairwise vertex-disjoint connected subgraphs of $G$, called {\em{branch sets}},
such that whenever $uv$ is an edge in~$H$, there are $u'\in I_u$ and $v'\in I_v$ for which $u'v'$ 
is an edge in $G$.
The graph $H$ is a {\em{depth-$r$ minor}} of $G$, denoted $H\minor_rG$, if there is a minor model
$(I_u)_{u\in V(H)}$ of~$H$ in $G$ such that each $I_u$ has radius at most $r$.

A class $\CCC$ of graphs is \emph{nowhere dense} if there is a function 
$t\colon \N\rightarrow \N$ such that for all $r\in \N$ it holds that $K_{t(r)}\not\minor_r G$
for all $G\in \CCC$, where $K_{t(r)}$ denotes the clique on $t(r)$ vertices.

A set $B\subseteq V(G)$ is called {\em{$r$-independent}} in a graph $G$ if  $\dist_G(u,v)>r$ for all
distinct $u,v\in B$.
A class $\CCC$ of graphs is \emph{uniformly quasi-wide} if there are
functions $N\colon \N\times\N\rightarrow \N$ and $s:\N\rightarrow \N$ such
that for all $r,m\in \N$, all graphs $G\in \CCC$, and all subsets $A\subseteq V(G)$ of size $\abs{A}\geq N(r,m)$, there is a set
$S\subseteq V(G)$ of size $\abs{S}\leq s(r)$ and a set
$B\subseteq A\setminus S$ of size $\abs{B}\geq m$ which is $r$-independent in
$G-S$. 

\paragraph{General strategy.}
Our proof follows the same lines as the original proof of Ne\v set\v ril and Ossona de Mendez, with the difference that in the key technical lemma (\cref{lem:apex} below), 
we improve the bounds significantly by replacing a Ramsey argument with a new combinatorial reasoning.
The new argument essentially originates in the concept of {\em{branching index}} from stability theory, 
and also uses the almost linear bound on neighborhood complexity in nowhere dense graph classes, due to Gajarsk\'y et al.~\cite{gajarsky2017kernelization}.
%For sake of completeness, we present the entire proof of~\cref{thm:new-uqw}.

We first prove a restricted variant,~\cref{lem:engine} below, in which we assume that $A$ is already $(r-1)$-independent. Then, in order to derive
\cref{thm:new-uqw}, we apply the lemma iteratively for $r$ ranging from $1$ to the target value.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:engine}
For every pair of integers $t,r\in \N$ there exists an integer $d<5r/2$ and a function $L\colon \N\to \N$ with $L(m)=\Oof_{r,t}{(m^{{(2t+1)}^{2rt}})}$ such that the following holds.
For each $m\in \N$, graph $G$ with $K_t\not\minor_{d} G$, and
$(r-1)$-independent set $A\subseteq V(G)$ of size at least $L(m)$, there is a set $S\subseteq V(G)-A$ of size at most $t$ such that $A$ contains a subset $A'$ of size $m$ which is $r$-independent in $G-S$.
Moreover, if $r$ is odd then $S$ is empty, and if $r$ is even,
then every vertex of $S$ is at distance exactly $r/2$ from every vertex of $A'$.
Finally, given $G$ and $A$, the sets $A'$ and $S$ can be computed in time $\Oof_{r,t}(|A|\cdot |E(G)|)$.
\end{lemma}

We prove~\cref{lem:engine} in \Cref{sec:engine}, but  a very rough sketch is as follows.
The  case of general~$r$ reduces to the case $r=1$ or $r=2$, depending on the parity of $r$,
by contracting the balls of radius $\lfloor \frac {r-1} 2\rfloor $ around the vertices in $A$ to single vertices.
The case of $r=1$ follows immediately from Ramsey's theorem. 
It turns out that the case $r=2$ is substantially more difficult.
We start by formulating and proving the main technical result needed for proving the case $r=2$.

\subsection{The main technical lemma}
The main tool is the following Ramsey-like result.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:apex}
For every integer $t\in \N$ and positive real $\alpha<\frac 1 2$ 
there is an integer $\ell_0\in\N$ with the following property.
Let $m,\ell\in \N$ be such that $\ell\ge \ell_0$. 
If~$G$ is a graph and $A$ is a $1$-independent set in $G$
with at least $(m+\ell)^{2t}$ elements,
then at least one of the following conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
  % \item $A$ contains the principal vertices of a $1$-subdivision of a clique $K_t$ contained in $G$,
  \item $K_t\minor_{2} G$,
\item  $A$ contains a $2$-independent set of size $m$, 
\item  some vertex $v$ of $G$
has at least $\ell^{\alpha}$ neighbors in $A$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, in each case, the corresponding structure (a depth-$2$ minor model, a $2$-independent set of size $m$, or a vertex $v$ as above) can be computed in time $\Oof_t(|A|\cdot |E(G)|)$.
\end{lemma}

We remark that a statement similar to that of \cref{lem:apex}
can be obtained by employing Ramsey's theorem, as has been done in~\cite{nevsetvril2011nowhere}. This, however, yields
in place of the bound $(m+\ell)^{2t}$ a bound of the form $R(m,\underbrace{q,q,\ldots,q}_{k\text{ times}})$,
where $k\sim\ell^{2\alpha}$ and $R(m_1,\ldots,m_c)$
is the Ramsey number for $c$ colors.
In particular, this does not give a bound which is polynomial in $m$, and thus cannot be used to prove~\cref{thm:new-uqw}.

\paragraph*{Neighborhood complexity.} Let us first recall the following result of Gajarsk\'y et al.~\cite{gajarsky2017kernelization}
which provides an upper bound on the number of distinct neighborhoods in a graph from a nowhere dense class.

\begin{lemma}[adaptation of Lemma 4.11 in \cite{gajarsky2017kernelization}]\label{lem:diversity}
Let $G$ be a graph such that $K_t\not\minor_{1} G$ for some constant $t\in \N$. 
Then for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists $n_0$, depending only on $t$ and $\epsilon$, such that for all $A\subseteq V(G)$ with $|A|\geq n_0$ it holds that
\[\abs{\{N(v)\cap A \colon v\in V(G)\}}\leq\abs{A}^{1+\epsilon}.\]
\end{lemma}



We remark that the proof of \cref{lem:diversity} uses only the fact that
nowhere dense classes of graphs do not have dense 
shallow minors~\cite{dvorak2007asymptotical,jiang2011compact}, and does not rely on any non-constructive arguments from stability theory.
In particular, $n_0$ depends in a computable manner on $t$ and $\epsilon$.
From \cref{lem:diversity} we derive the following.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:diversity}
  Let $G,A,t,\epsilon,n_0$ be as in \cref{lem:diversity}.
  Suppose $|A|\ge n_0$ and every pair of elements of $A$ has a common neighbor in $G$.
  Then there exists a vertex $v$ in $G$ which has at least $|A|^{(1-\epsilon)/2}$ neighbors in $A$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}Let ${\cal F}=\set{N(v)\cap A\colon v\in V(G)}$. 
  Let $k$ be the maximal cardinality of a set $F$ in ${\cal F}$.
  Say that an unordered pair $\{a,b\}$ of distinct elements of $A$ is \emph{covered} by $F\in {\cal F}$
  if  $a,b\in F$.
  By assumption, each of the $\binom{|A|}{2}$ unordered pairs of distinct elements of $A$ is covered by some element $F\in {\cal F}$, and,
  clearly, every $F\in {\cal F}$ can cover at most $\binom{k}{2}$ pairs. 
  Hence $\frac{\binom{|A|}{2}}{\binom{k}{2}}\leq |{\cal F}|\le  |A|^{1+\epsilon}$, implying $k\ge |A|^{(1-\epsilon)/2}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
\begin{corollary}\label{cor:biversity}
    For every positive real $\alpha<\frac 1 2$ and integer $t\in\N$ there exists an integer $\ell_0$ with the following property.
  Let $G$ be a graph such that $K_t\not\minor_2 G$
  and let
  $A$ be a $1$-independent subset of $G$ with $|A|\ge \ell_0$ such that every pair of vertices in $A$ has a common neighbor in $G$.
   Then there is a vertex $v\in G$
  with at least $|A|^{\alpha}$ neighbors in $A$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}\label{pf:}
  Define $H$ to be the bipartite graph induced 
  by $G$, with partite sets $A$ and $V(G)-A$; that is,  $v\in A$ and $w\in V(G)-A$ are adjacent in $H$ iff they are in $G$. 
  We claim that $K_{2t^2}\not\minor_1 H$. Indeed, it is easy to see that 
  since $H$ is bipartite, $K_{2t^2}\minor_1 H$ would imply that $H$ contains the 
  complete bipartite graph $K_{t^2,t^2}$,  which, in turn, implying that $K_{t}\minor_2 G$, contrary to our assumption.  
  
  Let $\ell_0$
    be the value $n_0$ from~\cref{lem:diversity} applied to $2t^2$ in place of $t$ and $\epsilon$ such that $(1-\epsilon)/2=\alpha$. Applying~\cref{cor:diversity} to $H,2t,\epsilon,\ell_0$, we conclude that if every pair of elements of $A$ has a common neighbor in $G$
    (hence also in $H$), then there is a vertex $v$
    of $H$ with at least $|A|^{\alpha}$ neighbors in~$A$.
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

% \begin{corollary}\label{lem:gajarsky}
% Let $G$ be a graph, let $s\in \N$, and suppose there is a constant $t\in \N$ such that $K_t\not\minor_{3s+1} G$.
% Then for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists $n_0$, depending only on $\epsilon,t,s$, such that for each vertex subset $A\subseteq V(G)$ that is $(2s+1)$-independent in $G$ and satisfies $|A|\geq n_0$, it holds that
% \[\abs{\{N_{s+1}[v]\cap A \colon v\in V(G)\}}\leq\abs{A}^{1+\epsilon}.\]
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{proof}
% As $A$ is $(2s+1)$-independent, we have that the $s$-neighborhoods of vertices from $A$ are pairwise disjoint.
% Obtain an $s$-shallow minor $H$ of $G$ by contracting $N_s[u]$ for each $u\in A$.
% We implicitly identify each vertex $u\in A$ with the vertex of $H$ obtained from contracting $N_s[u]$, thus $A\subseteq V(H)$.
% It is known that every $1$-shallow minor of $H$ is also a $(3s+1)$-shallow minor of $G$ (cf.~\cite[Proposition~4.1]{sparsity}), hence $K_t\not\minor_{1} H$.
%
% Let us fix $\epsilon>0$.
% Take any $v\in V(G)$. If $v\in N_s[u]$ for some $u\in A$, then since $A$ is $(2s+1)$-independent, we have that $v$ is at distance larger than $2s+1$ from any other vertex of $A$.
% Hence in this case we have $N_{s+1}[v]\cap A=\{u\}$ and there can be at most $|A|$ neighborhoods of this type.
% Next, suppose $v\notin N_s[u]$ for any $u\in A$. Then by the construction of $H$ we have that $N_{s+1}[v]\cap A=N^H[v]\cap A$, where $N^H[v]$ is the neighborhood of $v$ in $H$.
% Since $K_t\not\minor_{1} H$, by \cref{lem:diversity} we have that the number of such neighborhoods is at most $|A|^{1+\epsilon/2}$,
% provided $|A|\geq n_0$ for some $n_0$ depending only on $t$ and $\varepsilon$.
% Thus, we conclude that $\abs{\{N_{s+1}[v]\cap A \colon v\in V(G)\}}\leq |A|+|A|^{1+\epsilon/2}$, which is bounded by $|A|^{1+\epsilon}$ if we choose $n_0$ large enough.
% \end{proof}
%
% %Observe that nowhere dense classes are closed under
% %taking bounded depth minors, as stated in the following lemma.
% %It is an immediate consequence of Proposition~4.1
% %of~\cite{sparsity}.
%
% %\begin{lemma}
% %Let $\CCC$ be a nowhere dense class of graphs and let $s\in \N$.
% %Then also the class $\{H \minor_s G \colon G\in \CCC\}$ is nowhere dense.
% %\end{lemma}





\paragraph*{Proof of \cref{lem:apex}.} We proceed with the proof of \cref{lem:apex}, which spans the whole remainder of this section.
We will arrange the elements of $A$ in a binary tree
and prove that the tree contains a long path. From this path, we will 
extract the set $A'$. In stability theory, similar trees are called \emph{type trees} and they are used to extract long indiscernible sequences, see e.g.~\cite{malliaris2014regularity}. 


\newcommand{\dau}{\mathrm{D}}
\newcommand{\son}{\mathrm{S}}
	
	We identify words in $\set{\dau,\son}^*$ with \emph{nodes}
	of the infinite rooted binary tree. 
  The \emph{depth} of a node $w$ is the length of $w$.
  For $w\in \set{\dau,\son}^*$,
	 the nodes $w\dau$ and $w\son$ are called, respectively, the \emph{daughter} and the \emph{son} of $w$,
	and $w$ is the \emph{parent} of both $w\son$ and $w\dau$. A node $w'$ is a {\em{descendant}} of a node $w$ if $w'$ is a prefix of $w$ (possibly $w'=w$).
	We consider
	 finite, labeled, rooted, binary trees, which are called simply trees below, and are defined as follows.
	 A \emph{tree} is a partial function $\tau\from \set{\dau,\son}^*\to U$ whose domain is a finite set of nodes, called the \emph{nodes of $\tau$}, which is closed under taking parents. If $v$ is a node of $\tau$, then $\tau(v)$ is called its \emph{label}.
  
  Let $G$ be a graph, $A\subset V(G)$ be a $1$-independent set in $G$,
  and $\bar a$ be an enumeration of $A$.
We define  a binary tree $\tau$ which is 
  labeled by vertices of $G$. The tree is defined by processing all elements of $\bar a$ sequentially. We start with $\tau$ being the  tree with empty domain, and for each element $a$ of the sequence $\bar a$, processed in the order given by $\bar a$, execute the following procedure which results in adding a node with label $a$ to $\tau$.
  
When processing the vertex $a$, do the following. Start with $w$ being the empty word. While~$w$ is a node of $\tau$, repeat the following step: 
  if the distance from $a$ to $\tau(w)$ in the graph 
  $G$ is at most~$2$, replace $w$ by its son, otherwise, replace $w$ by its daughter.
  % Repeat the step, unless $\tau(w)$ is undefined.
  Once $w$ is not a node of $\tau$, extend $\tau$ by setting  $\tau(w)=a$. In this way, we have processed the element $a$, and now
    proceed to the next element $a$ of $\bar a$, until all elements are processed. This ends the construction of $\tau$.
	

Define the
\emph{depth} of $\tau$ as 
the maximal depth of a node of $\tau$.
For a word $w$, define an \emph{alternation} to be 
a position $i$ such that $w_i\neq w_{i-1}$, where $w_0$ is assumed to be $\dau$.
 The \emph{alternation rank} of the tree $\tau$ is the maximum of the number of alternations of $w$, over all nodes $w$ of $\tau$.


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:number-of-nodes}
Let $h,t\ge 2$.	If $\tau$ has alternation rank at most $2t-1$ and depth at most $h-1$, then~$\tau$ has fewer than $h^{2t}$ nodes.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}		
	To each node $w$ of $\tau$ assign 
	the function $f_w\colon \set{1,\ldots,2t}\to\set{1,\ldots,h}$ defined as follows:
	$f_w$ maps each $i\in \set{1,\ldots,2t}$ to the $i$th alternation of $w$, provided $i$ is at most the number of alternations of $w$, and otherwise we put $f_w(i)=|w|+1$.
	It is clear that the mapping $w\mapsto f_w$ for nodes $w$ of $\tau$ is injective
and its image is contained in monotone functions, hence the domain of~$\tau$ 
		has fewer than $h^{2t}$ elements.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:alternation-rank-type-tree}
Suppose that  $K_t\not\minor_{2} G$.
Then $\tau$ has alternation rank at most $2t-1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $w$ be a node of $\tau$ with at least $2k$ alternations, for some $k\in \N$.
	In particular, there are vertices $a_1,b_1,\ldots,a_k,b_k$ in $A$
	such that for each $i\in \set{1,\ldots,k}$, 
	the nodes in $\tau$ corresponding to $b_i,a_{i+1},b_{i+1},\ldots,a_k,b_k$ are  descendants of the son of the node which corresponds to $a_i$,
	and the nodes corresponding to $a_{i+1},b_{i+1},\ldots,a_k,b_k$
	are descendants of the daughter of the node which corresponds to $b_i$.
	
	\begin{claim}\label{claim:minor}
		For every pair $a_i,b_j$ with $1\le i\le j\le k$, there is a vertex $z_{ij}\not\in A$		which is a common neighbor of $a_i$ and $b_j$,
		and is not a neighbor of any $b_s$ with $s\neq j$.
	\end{claim}
	\begin{clproof}
		Note that since $i\le j$, the node of corresponding to $b_j$ is a descendant of the son of the node corresponding to $a_i$, hence we have $\dist_G(a_i,b_j)\le 2$ by the construction of $\tau$.
		However, we also have $\dist_G(a_i,b_j)>1$ since $A$
		is $1$-independent. Therefore $\dist_G(a_i,b_j)=2$, so there is a vertex $z_{ij}$ which is a common neighbor of $a_i$ and $b_j$. 
		Suppose that $z_{ij}$ was a neighbor of $b_s$, for some $s\neq j$. This would imply that $\dist_G(b_j,b_s)\le 2$, which is impossible, 
since
		 the nodes corresponding to $b_s$ and $b_j$ in $\tau$ are such that one is a descendant of the daughter of the other, implying that $\dist_G(b_s,b_j)>2$.
	\end{clproof}
  
Note that whenever $i\leq j$ and $i'\leq j'$ are such that $j\neq j'$, the vertices $z_{ij}$ and $z_{i'j'}$ are different, because $z_{ij}$ is adjacent to $b_{j}$ but not to $b_{j'}$, and the converse holds for $z_{i'j'}$.
However, it may happen that $z_{ij}=z_{i'j}$ even if $i\neq i'$. This will not affect our further reasoning.

For each $j\in\set{1,\ldots,k}$, define the graph $B_j$
as the subgraph of $G$ induced by the set
$\set{a_j,b_j}\cup\set{z_{ij}\colon 1\le i\le  j}$.
By \cref{thm:alternation-rank-type-tree} and the discussion from the previous paragraph, the graphs $B_j$ for $j\in \set{1,\ldots,k}$
are pairwise disjoint.
Moreover, for all $1\le i\le j\le k$, there is an edge between $B_i$
and $B_j$, namely, the edge between $z_{ij}\in B_j$
and $a_i\in B_i$.
Hence, the graphs $B_j$, for $j\in \set{1,\ldots,k}$, define a depth-$2$ minor model of $K_k$ in $G$. Since $K_t\not\minor_{2}G$, this implies that $k<t$, proving~\cref{thm:alternation-rank-type-tree}.
\end{proof}

To prove~\cref{lem:apex}, 
choose $\epsilon=1-2\alpha$ so that $\alpha=\frac{1-\epsilon}{2}$; note that $0<\epsilon<1$.
Let $n_0$ be the integer given by~\cref{lem:diversity} for $t$ and $\epsilon$; w.l.o.g. $n_0\geq 2$.
We put $\ell_0=n_0$.
Fix integers $\ell\ge \ell_0$ and~$m$, and define $h=m+\ell$.
Let $A$ be a $1$-independent set in $G$
of size at least $h^{2t}$.

Suppose that the first case of \cref{lem:apex} does not hold. In particular $K_t\not\minor_2 G$, so by \cref{thm:alternation-rank-type-tree},~$\tau$ has alternation rank at most $2t-1$. From \cref{lem:number-of-nodes} 
we conclude that $\tau$  has depth at least~$h$.
As $h=m+\ell$, it follows that either $\tau$  has a node $w$ which contains at least $m$ letters~$\dau$, or $\tau$ has a node $w$ which contains  at least $\ell$ letters $\son$.

Consider the first case, i.e., there is a node $w$ of $\tau$
which contains at least $m$ letters $\dau$, and let $X$
be the set of all vertices $\tau(u)$ such that $u\dau$ is a prefix of $w$. Then, by construction, $X$ is a $2$-independent set in $G$ of size at least $m$, so the second case of the lemma holds.

Finally, consider the second case, i.e., there is a node $w$ in $\tau$ which contains at least $\ell$ letters~$\son$. Let 
$Y$ be the set of all vertices $\tau(u)$ such that $u\son$ is a prefix of $w$. Then, by construction, $Y\subset A$ is a set of vertices which are mutually at distance exactly $2$ in $G$. 
Since $K_t\not\minor_2 G$, by~\cref{cor:diversity} we infer that there is a vertex $v\in G$
with at least $\ell^{\frac{1-\epsilon}{2}}=\ell^{\alpha}$ neighbors in $Y$.
This finishes the proof of the first part of~\cref{lem:apex}.

The proof above yields an algorithm which first constructs the tree $\tau$, by 
iteratively processing each vertex $w$ of $A$ and testing whether the distance between $w$ and each vertex processed already is equal to $2$.
This amounts to running a breadth-first search from every vertex of $A$, which can be done in time $\Oof(|A|\cdot |E(G)|)$.
Whenever a node with $2t$ alternations 
is inserted to $\tau$, we can exhibit in $G$ a depth-$2$ minor model of $K_t$.
Whenever a node with least $m$ letters $\dau$ is added to $\tau$,
we have constructed an $m$-independent set. Whenever a node with at least $\ell$ letters $\son$ is added to $\tau$, as argued, there must be some vertex $v\in V(G)-A$ with at least $\ell^\alpha$ neighbors in~$A$. 
To find such a vertex, scan through all neighborhoods of vertices $v\in A$ in the graph $G$, and then select a vertex $w\in V(G)$
which belongs to the largest number of those neighborhoods; this can be done in time $\Oof(|E(G)|)$.
The overall running time is $\Oof(|A|\cdot |E(G)|)$, as required.

This finishes the proof of~\cref{lem:apex}.

\subsection{Proof of~\cref{lem:engine}}
\label{sec:engine}
% To prove~\cref{lem:engine}, we distinguish two special cases: the case of $r=1$ and the case $r=2$. The case of general $r$ then reduces to one of these two cases, depending on the parity of $r$, by observing that a $(2s+1)$-independent set $A$ in $G$
% induces a $1$-independent set in $G$ with the balls of radius $s$ around the vertices of $A$ contracted, and,
% similarly, a $(2s+2)$-independent set $A$ in $G$
% induces a $2$-independent set in $G$ with the balls of radius $s$ around the vertices of $A$ contracted.

With \cref{lem:apex} proved, we can proceed with~\cref{lem:engine}. 
We start with the case $r=1$, then we move to the case $r=2$. 
Next we show how the general case reduces to one of those two cases.
% , and, finally, we deduce~\cref{thm:new-uqw} from~\cref{lem:engine}.

\paragraph{Case $r=1$.}
We put $d=0$, thus we assume that $K_t\not\minor_0 G$; that is, $G$ does not contain a clique of size $t$ as a subgraph. By Ramsey's Theorem, in every graph every set of size $\binom{m+t-2}{t-1}$ contains an
independent set of size $m$ or a clique of size $t$. Therefore, 
taking $L(m)$ as the above binomial coefficient yields~\cref{lem:engine} in case $r=0$, for $S=\emptyset$. Note here that $\binom{m+t-2}{t-1}\in\Oof_{t}{(m^{{(2t+1)}^{2t}})}$.
Moreover, such independent set or clique can be computed from $G$ and $A$ in time~$\Oof(|A|\cdot |E(G)|)$ by simulating the proof of Ramsey's theorem.

\paragraph{Case $r=2$.}
We put $d=2$, thus we assume that $K_t\not\minor_2 G$.
Namely, we show that if $A$ is a sufficiently large $1$-independent set in a graph $G$ such that $K_t\not\minor_2 G$, 
then there is a set of vertices~$S$ of size at most $t$ such that $A\setminus S$ contains a subset of size $m$ which is $2$-independent in $G-S$. 
Here, by ``sufficiently large'' we mean of size of size at least $L(m)$, for $L(m)$ emerging from the proof.
To this end, we shall iteratively apply \cref{lem:apex} as long as  it results in the third case, 
yielding a vertex $v$ with many neighbors in $A$. In this case, we add $v$ vertex to the set $S$, and apply the lemma again,
restricting $A$ to $A\cap N(v)$. 
The precise calculations follow.

\newcommand{\mbull}{\widehat{m}}

Fix a number $\beta>2t$. For $k\ge 0$,
define $m_k=((k+1)\cdot m)^{(2\beta)^k}$.
We will apply~\cref{lem:apex} in the following form.
\begin{claim}\label{cor:apex}
  % Let $t$ be an integer and $\beta>2\cdot t$ a real.
	There is an integer $\mbull$, depending only on $t$ and $\beta$, such that for all $m\ge \mbull$ and $k\ge 1$, the following holds.
	If $G$ is a graph such that $K_t\not\minor_2 G$, and
	$A\subset V(G)$ is an $1$-independent set in $G$ which does not contain a $2$-independent set of size $m$ and satisfies $|A|\ge m_k$, %$((k+1)\cdot m)^{\beta ^k}$
	then there exists a vertex $v$ of $G$ such that $|N_G(v)\cap A| \ge m_{k-1}$.%$(k\cdot m)^{\beta^{k-1}}$.
\end{claim}
\begin{clproof}
Let $\alpha=t/\beta$, so that $\alpha<1/2$.
Put $\mbull= \ell^{\alpha}=\ell_0^{t/\beta}$, where $\ell_0$ is the constant given by \cref{lem:apex} for $t$ and $\alpha$.
Let $\ell=(k\cdot m)^{(2\beta)^{k-1}/\alpha}$.
Then $m\ge \mbull$ implies that $\ell\ge\ell_0$.
Observe that
$$|A|\ge \left((k+1)\cdot m\right)^{(2\beta)^k}=\left ((m+ k\cdot m)^{(2\beta)^{k-1}/\alpha} \right)^{2t}
\ge (m+(k\cdot m)^{(2\beta)^{k-1}/\alpha})^{2t}=(m+\ell)^{2t}.$$
Therefore, we may  apply \cref{lem:apex}, yielding a vertex $v$ with at least $\ell^\alpha=(k\cdot m)^{(2\beta)^{k-1}}=m_{k-1}$ neighbors in~$A$.
\end{clproof}

% \begin{proof}  [of~\cref{lem:engine}]

Let $\mbull$ be the number given by~\cref{cor:apex}. 
In the following we assume that $m\geq \max(t,\mbull)$, for we may always ask for finding a $2$-independent set of size $\max(t,\mbull,m)$ instead of $m$.
We will find 
a subset of $A$ of size $m$ which is $2$-independent in $G-S$, where $|S|\le t$.


Assume that $|A|\ge m_t$. By induction, we
 construct a sequence  $A=A_0\supseteq A_1\supseteq\ldots$ 
of $1$-independent subsets of $G$
of length at most $t$
such that $|A_i|\ge m_{t-i}$,
 as follows. Start with $A_0=A$. We maintain a set $S$ of vertices of $G$ which is initially empty, and we maintain the invariant that $A_i$ is disjoint with $S$ at each step of the induction.

For $i=0,1,2,\ldots$, do as follows.
If $A_{i}$ contains a $2$-independent set of size $m$ in $G-S$, terminate.
 Otherwise, 
 apply~\cref{cor:apex} to the graph $G-S$ with $1$-independent set
 $A_{i}$ of size $|A_i|\ge m_{t-i}$. This yields a vertex $v_{i+1}$ of $G-S$
 whose neighborhood in $G-S$ contains at least
 $m_{t-i-1}$ vertices of $A_{i}$.
 Let $A_{i+1}$ consist of those vertices, and add $v_{i+1}$
 to the set~$S$.  
  If $i\le t$, proceed by replacing $i$ by $i+1$.

\begin{claim}\label{claim:at-most-t}
	The construction halts after less than $t$ steps.
\end{claim}
\begin{clproof}
Suppose that the construction proceeds for $k\le t$ steps.
By construction, each vertex~$v_i$, for $i\le k$, is adjacent in $G$
 to all the vertices of $A_{j}$, for each $i\le j\le k$. In particular, all the vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ are adjacent to all the vertices of $A_{k}$
 and $|A_k|\ge m_{t-k}\ge m\ge t$.
Choose any pairwise distinct vertices $w_1,\ldots,w_k\in A_k$ and observe that the connected subgraphs $\set{w_i,v_i}$ of~$G$ yield a depth-$1$ minor model of $K_k$ in $G$.
 Since $K_t\not\minor_2 G$, we must have $k<t$.
 \end{clproof}
 
 Therefore, at some step $k<t$ of the construction we must have obtained a $2$-independent subset $A'$ of $G-S$ of size $m$. Moreover, $|S|\le k<t$.
 
 
 
 This proves~\cref{lem:engine} in the case $r=2$, for the function $L(m)=m_t=((t+1)\cdot m)^{\beta^{2t}}$
 for $m\ge \max(t,\mbull)$ and $L(m)=m_{\max(t,\mbull)}$ for $m<\max(t,\mbull)$, where $\beta>2\cdot t$ is any fixed constant and $\mbull$ is obtained from~\cref{cor:apex}.
 It is easy to see that then $L_t(m)=L(m)\in \Oof_{t}{(m^{{(2t+1)}^{2t}})}$, provided we put $\beta=2t+1$.
 Also, the proof easily yields an algorithm constructing the sets~$A'$ and $S$,
 which amounts to applying at most $t$ times the algorithm of~\cref{lem:apex}.
 Hence, its running time  is $\Oof_{r,t}(|A|\cdot |E(G)|)$, as required.
% \end{proof}


\paragraph{Odd case.}
We prove~\cref{lem:engine} in the case when $r=2s+1$, for some integer $s\geq 1$. We put $d=s=\frac{r-1}{2}$.
Let $G$ be a graph such that $K_t\not\minor_s G$, and 
 let $A$ be a $2s$-independent set in $G$. Consider the graph $G'$ obtained from $G$
by contracting the (pairwise disjoint) balls of radius $s$ around each vertex $v\in A$.
 Let $A'$ denote the set of vertices of $G'$ corresponding to the contracted balls. There is a natural bijection between $A$ and $A'$.
From $K_t\not\minor_s G$ it follows that~$G'$ does not contain $K_t$ as a subgraph. Applying the already proved case $r=1$ to $G'$ and $A'$, we conclude that 
if $|A|=|A'|\ge {m+t-2\choose t-1}$, then
 $A'$ contains a $1$-independent subset $B$ of size $m$,
 which corresponds to a $(2s+1)$-independent set in $G$ that is contained in $A$.
 Hence, the obtained bound is $L(m)={m+t-2\choose t-1}$, and we have already argued that then $L(m)\in \Oof_{r,t}{(m^{{(2t+1)}^{2t}})}$.
 
 
 \paragraph{Even case.}
 Finally,
 we prove~\cref{lem:engine} in the case $r=2s+2$, for some integer $s\geq 1$. We put $d=5s+2=5r/2-3$.
Let $G$  be such that 
 $K_t\not\minor_{d} G$, and
let $A$ be a $(2s+1)$-independent set in $G$. Consider the graph $G'$ obtained from $G$
by contracting the (pairwise disjoint) balls of radius $s$ around each vertex $v\in A$.
 Let $A'$ denote the set of vertices of $G'$ corresponding to the contracted balls. Again, there is a bijection between $A$ and $A'$. Note that
this time, $A'$ is a $1$-independent set in $G'$.
From $K_t\not\minor_{5s+2} G$ it follows that $K_t\not\minor_2 G'$. Apply the already proved case $r=2$ to $G'$ and $A'$. 
Then, if $|A|=|A'|\ge L_t(m)$, where $L_t(m)$ is the function as defined in the case $r=2$, then
 $A'$ contains a subset $B'$ of size $m$
which is  $2$-independent in $G'-S'$, for some $S'\subset V(G')-A'$.
The set $S'$ corresponds to some set of vertices $S\subset V(G)$
which are at distance at least $s+1$ from each vertex in $A$,
and the set  $B'$ corresponds to some subset $B$ of $A$
which is $(2s+2)$-independent in $G-S$. Moreover, as each vertex of $S'$
is a neighbor of each vertex of $B'$,  each vertex of $S$
has distance exactly $s+1=r/2$ from each vertex of $B$.

\medskip
An algorithm computing the sets $B$ and $S$ (in either the odd or even case) can be given as follows:
simply run a breadth-first search from each vertex of $A$ to compute the graph $G'$ with the balls of radius  $\lfloor \frac{r-1}2 \rfloor$  around the vertices in $A$ contracted to single vertices, 
and then run the algorithm for the case $r=1$ or $r=2$.
This yields a running time of  $\Oof_{r,t}(|A|\cdot |E(G)|)$.
 \medskip
  
This finishes  the proof of~\cref{lem:engine}.

\begin{remark}
A more careful analysis of the case $r=2s+2$, in particular of the construction of $G'$ and the properties of $G'$ actually used in the proof of \cref{claim:minor},
shows that the bound of $d=5s+2$ may be decreased to $d=3s+2$. We refrain from giving the details for the sake of clarity of the argument.
\end{remark}

\begin{comment}
\begin{remark}
	It is not difficult to decrease the bound from $d=5s+2$ to $d= 3s+2$
	in the  case when $r=2s+2$. To do so, one would need to formulate~\cref{lem:apex}
	a bit more carefully, and replace the first possibility $K_t\minor_2 G$
	by the following condition, corresponding to the statement of~\cref{claim:minor}:
\begin{quote}
	There are vertices $a_1,b_1,\ldots,a_t,b_t\in A$ 
	such that for each $1\le i\le j\le t$, there is a vertex $z_{ij}\in V(G)-A$
	which is a neighbor of $a_i$ and $b_j$, but not of $b_s$, for $s\neq j$.

\subsection{Proof of \cref{thm:new-uqw}}
We now wrap up the proof of \cref{thm:new-uqw} by iteratively applying~\cref{lem:engine}.

%\begin{lemma}\label{lem:ramsey2}
%Let $G$ be a graph such that $K_t\not\minor_r G$. 
%If $A$ is $2r$-independent and
%has size at least $\binom{m+t-2}{t-1}$, then there exists
%a subset $B\subseteq A$ of size at least $m$ which is a
%$(2r+1)$-independent set. 
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%As $A$ is $2r$-independent, we can contract the $r$-neighborhood
%of each $v\in A$. The corresponding elements $N_r[v]$ in the resulting 
%depth-$r$ minor $H$ form a set $Z$ that is in \mbox{$1$-to-$1$} correspondence 
%with $A$. By assumption, 
%$H[Z]$ excludes $K_t$ as a subgraph, and hence by \cref{lem:ramsey1},
%it contains an independent set $B'\subseteq Z$ of size $m$ in $H$. 
%This set $B'$ corresponds to a $(2r+1)$-independent set $B\subseteq A$ of $G$. 
%\end{proof}
%
%\begin{lemma}\label{lem:distance-apex}
%Let $\CCC$ be a nowhere dense class of graphs. 
%Let $n_0$ be the constant of for $\epsilon=1/3$. 
%Assume $K_t\not\minor_{r+2} G$. 
%Let $m\geq n_0$ be an integer. 
%Let $A$ be a $(2r+1)$-independent set in $G$ of size at least $R(m,t)$. 
%Then there is a subset $A'\subseteq A$ of size at least~$m$ and a 
%a set $S\subseteq V(G)\setminus A$ of size at most $t-1$ such that
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item every vertex of $S$ is connected to a vertex at distance $r$ of $w$ for 
%every $w\in A'$, and
%\item $A'$ is $(2r+2)$-independent in $G-S$. 
%\end{enumerate} 
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%As $A$ is $(2r+1)$-independent, we can contract the $r$-neighborhood
%of each $v\in A$. The corresponding elements $N_r[v]$ in the resulting 
%depth-$r$ minor $H$ form a set $Z$ that is in $1$-to-$1$ correspondence 
%with $A$. As $A$
%is $(2r+1)$-independent, $Z$ is independent in $H$. We now apply 
%\cref{lem:iterate-apex} to $Z$ in $H$. Note that the depth-$2$ minor
%we construct in \cref{thm:alternation-rank-type-tree} (now applied to $H$) 
%uses as connecting vertices $z_{ij}$ original vertices of the graph and
%not contracted vertices. Hence, when we apply the lemma, we may 
%use the assumption that $K_t\not\minor_{r+2} G$ (in general, 
%a depth-$2$ minor of a depth-$r$ minor may be a depth-$5r$ minor
%of the original graph~see Proposition~4.1 of~\cite{sparsity}). 
%Also, the vertices $v$ returned by 
%\cref{lem:iterate-apex} correspond to vertices of the graph $G$ and not
%to contracted neighborhoods. In particular, as $A$ is $(2r+1)$-independent, 
%the vertices $v$ returned by the lemma have distance exactly $r$ to 
%the vertices $w\in A$. The set $Z'$ returned by \cref{lem:iterate-apex}
%for $H$ is $2$-independent in $H$, and hence the corresponding 
%subset $B\subseteq A$ of $G$ is $(2r+2)$-independent. 
%in $G$. 
%\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[of \cref{thm:new-uqw}]
Fix integers $r,t$,  and a graph $G$ such that $K_t\not\minor_{d} G$,
for $d=\lfloor 5r/2 \rfloor$. Let $\beta>2\cdot t$ be a fixed real, and let $\mbull$ be the number from~\cref{cor:apex}. As in the proof of \cref{lem:engine}, without loss of generality suppose $m\geq \max(t,\mbull)$.
 Denote $\gamma=\beta^{2t}$, and
define the function $L(m)$ as $L(m)=((t+1)\cdot m)^\gamma$.

Define the sequence $m_0,m_1,\ldots,m_r$ as follows:
$$m_i=(t+1)^{\gamma^{r-i}}\cdot m^{\gamma^{r-i}}.$$ 
Note that $m_r\geq m$ and $m_i=L(m_{i+1})$, for all $i\in \set{0,\ldots,r-1}$.

Suppose that $A$ is a set of vertices of $G$ such that $|A|\ge m_0=(t+1)^{\gamma^{r}}\cdot m^{\gamma^{r}}$. 
We inductively construct sequences of sets $A= A_0\supseteq A_1\supseteq \ldots \supseteq A_r$ and $\emptyset=S_0\subseteq S_1\subseteq S_2\ldots$
satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $|A_i|\ge m_i \ge L(m_{i+1})$,
	\item $A_i\cap S_i=\emptyset$ and $A_i$ is $i$-independent in $G-S_i$.
\end{itemize}
To construct $A_{i+1}$ out of $A_i$, apply~\cref{lem:engine} to the graph $G-S_i$ and 
the $i$-independent set $A_i$ of size at least $L(m_{i+1})$. This yields a set $S\subseteq V(G)$ which is disjoint from $S_i\cup A_i$, and a subset $A_{i+1}$ of $A_i$ of size 
at least $m_{i+1}$
which is $(i+1)$-independent in $G-S_{i+1}$, where $S_{i+1}=S\cup S_i$. This completes the inductive construction.

In particular,  $|A_r|\ge m$ and $A_r$ is a subset of $A$ which is $r$-independent in $G-S_r$.
Observe that by construction, $|S_r|\le r t/2$, as in the odd steps, the constructed set $S$ is empty, and in the even steps, it has at most $t$ elements. 
We show that in fact we have $|S_r|<t$ using the following argument, similar to the one used in~\cref{claim:at-most-t}.


By the last part of the statement of~\cref{lem:engine},  at the $i$th step of the construction, each vertex of the set $S$
has distance exactly $i/2$ from all vertices in $A_{i+1}$ in the graph 
$G-S_i$. 
For $a\in A_r$, let $\overline{N}(a)$ denote the $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$-neighborhood of $a$ in $G-S_r$; note that sets $\overline{N}(a)$ are pairwise disjoint.
The above remark implies that each vertex $v$ of the final set $S_r$ has a neighbor in the set $\overline{N}(a)$ for each $a\in A_r$.
Indeed, suppose $v$ belonged to the set $S$ added to $S_r$ in the $i$th step of the construction; i.e. $v\in S_{i+1}\setminus S_i$.
Then there exists a path in $G-S_i$ from $v$ to $a$ of length exactly $i/2$, which traverses only vertices at distance less than $i/2$ from $a$.
Since in this and further steps of the construction we were removing only vertices at distance at least $i/2$ from $a$, this path stays intact in $G-S_r$ and hence is completely contained in $\overline{N}(a)$.

By assumption that $m\ge t$, we may choose pairwise different vertices $a_1,\ldots,a_t\in A_r$.
To reach a contradiction, suppose that $S_r$ contains $t$ distinct vertices $s_1,\ldots,s_t$. 
By the above, the sets $\overline{N}(a_i)\cup\set{s_i}$ 
form a minor model of $K_t$ in $G$ at depth-$(\lfloor r/2\rfloor+1)$.
This contradicts the assumption that $K_t\not\minor_d G$ for $d=\lfloor 5r/2 \rfloor$.
Hence, $|S|<t$.


Define the function  $N:\N\to\N$
as $N(m)=((t+1)m)^{\gamma^{r}}=((t+1)m)^{\beta^{2rt}}$
for $m\ge \max(t,\mbull)$  and $N(m)=N(\mbull)$ for $m<\max(t,\mbull)$.
Note that $N(m)\in \Oof_{r,t}{(m^{{(2t+1)}^{2rt}})}$, provided we put $\beta=2t+1$.
The argument above shows that if $|A|\ge N(m)$ then 
there is a set $S\subset V(G)$, equal to $S_r$ above,
and a set $B\subset A$, equal to $A_r$ above,
so that $B$ is $r$-independent in $G-S$.
Given $G$ and $A$, the sets $S$ and $B$ can be computed by applying the algorithm given by~\cref{lem:engine} at most~$r$ times, so in time $\Oof_{r,t}(|A|\cdot |E(G)|)$.
This finishes the proof of~\cref{thm:new-uqw}.
\end{proof}
