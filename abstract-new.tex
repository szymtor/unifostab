% Nowhere dense classes of graphs were introduced
% by Ne\v set\v ril and Ossona de
% Mendez~\cite{nevsetvril2010first,nevsetvril2011nowhere} as a model
% for uniform sparseness of graphs. The concept of nowhere denseness
% turns out to be very robust, as witnessed by the fact that it is equivalent
% to multiple other concepts studied in different areas of mathematics.
% In this work we revisit connections between nowhere
% denseness and notions from (finite) model theory.
%
% Based on the work of Podewski and Ziegler~\cite{podewski1978stable},
% Adler and Adler~\cite{adler2014interpreting}
% proved that every nowhere dense class $\CCC$ of graphs is stable; that is,
% the ladder index of every first-order formula $\phi(\tup{x},\tup{y})$ over
% graphs from $\CCC$ is bounded by a constant depending only on $\phi$ and
% $\CCC$. The original proof of this fact is based on an infinite
% Ramsey argument that does not yield any explicit bounds on ladder indices.
We study nowhere dense classes of graphs, recently introduced by
Ne\v set\v ril and Ossona de
 Mendez~\cite{nevsetvril2010first,nevsetvril2011nowhere}.
Firstly, we provide a new proof for the fact that these classes 
are uniformly quasi-wide, improving previously known bounds
between the two equivalent notions. 
Secondly, 
we give a new combinatorial proof of the result of Adler and Adler~\cite{adler2014interpreting} stating that nowhere dense classes of graphs are stable.
In contrast to the original proof, our proof is completely finitistic and yields explicit bounds for ladder indices of
first-order formulas on nowhere dense classes of graphs. \textcolor{red}{Finally, let $\CCC$ be a nowhere dense class of graphs, let $\epsilon>0$ and let $\psi(\tup x,y)$ be a first-order formula, where 
$\tup x$ is an $m$-tuple of variables and $y$ is a single variable. We prove that there is a constant $c$ such that for every $G\in \CCC$ and every
$A\subseteq V(G)$, the number of $\psi$-types over $A$, that is, $|S_\psi(A,G)|=|\{\{\tup a\ \in A^m : G\models\psi(\tup a,v)\} : v\in V(G)\}|$, is bounded by $c\cdot |A|^{1+\epsilon}$. Similarly, if $\CCC$ has bounded expansion and $\psi(\tup x,y)$ is a first-order formula, where~$\tup x$ is an $m$-tuple of variables and $y$ is a single variable, 
then we prove that there is a constant~$c$ such that for every $G\in \CCC$ and every
$A\subseteq V(G)$ we have $|S_\psi(A,G)|\leq c\cdot |A|$. For classes of graphs that are closed under taking subgraphs we 
derive new characterizations of nowhere denseness and bounded expansion.}
