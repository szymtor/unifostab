We study nowhere dense classes of graphs, recently introduced by Ne\v
set\v ril and Ossona de
Mendez~\cite{nevsetvril2010first,nevsetvril2011nowhere}.  Firstly, we
provide a new proof for the fact that these classes are uniformly
quasi-wide and improve previously known bounds on the functions
relating the two notions.  Secondly, we give a new combinatorial proof
of the result of Adler and Adler~\cite{adler2014interpreting} stating
that nowhere dense classes of graphs are stable.  In contrast to the
original proof, our proof is completely finitistic and yields explicit
bounds for ladder indices of first order formulas on nowhere dense
classes of graphs.  Finally, we establish almost linear bounds on the
VC-density of families of first order definable sets in nowhere 
dense classes. More precisely, we prove that for every nowhere
dense class of graphs the number of subsets of $n$-tuples over a parameter 
set $A$ definable by a first order formula $\phi(\tup x,\tup y)$
with $n$ object
variables $\tup y$ is bounded by $\Oof(|A|^{n+\epsilon})$, for every $\epsilon>0$. 
%
%More precisely, let
%$\CCC$ be a nowhere dense class of graphs and let
%$\psi(\tup x,\tup y)$ be a first order formula, where $\tup x$ is an
%$m$-tuple and $\tup y$ is an $n$-tuple of variables.  For a graph $G$
%and $A\subseteq V(G)$ let
%$S_\psi(A,G)=\{\{\tup a\ \in A^m : G\models\psi(\tup a,\tup b)\} :
%\tup b\in V(G)^n\}$.  We prove that
%\[\limsup_{a\rightarrow \infty}\max_{\substack{G\in\CCC\\A\subseteq
%    V(G), |A|=a}}\frac{\log |S_\psi(A,G)|}{\log a}\leq n.\]

%We want to highlight that the present paper
%can be read without any knowledge of model 
%theory beyond the basics of first order logic.

%
% \sebi{Finally, let $\CCC$ be a nowhere dense class of graphs, let
% $\epsilon>0$ and let $\psi(\tup x,y)$ be a first order formula,
% where~ $\tup x$ is an $m$-tuple of variables and $y$ is a single
% variable. We prove that there is a constant $c$ such that for every
% $G\in \CCC$ and every $A\subseteq V(G)$, the number of $\psi$-types
% over $A$, that is,
% $|S_\psi(A,G)|=|\{\{\tup a\ \in A^m : G\models\psi(\tup a,v)\} :
% v\in V(G)\}|$, is bounded by $c\cdot |A|^{1+\epsilon}$.
% \begin{change}{sz}Moreover, if $\CCC$ has bounded expansion, then
%   the $\epsilon$ in the exponent can be dropped.\end{change} For
% classes of graphs that are closed under taking subgraphs we derive
% new characterizations of bounded expansion and nowhere denseness.}
