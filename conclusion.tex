\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we studied the interplay of combinatorial and 
logical properties of nowhere dense graph classes. We proved
asymptotically optimal bounds on the VC-density of first-order 
formulas on nowhere dense classes. We also provided new
upper bounds on quantities related to stability and uniform quasi-wideness 
of nowhere dense classes.  All our proofs are purely combinatorial 
and yield explicit and computable upper bounds. In particular 
for uniform quasi-wideness, we provided a new
proof of polynomial upper bounds on the functions 
governing this notion. 

We remark that our results can easily be lifted for classes of edge- and 
vertex-colored graphs. Classes that remain stable (resp.\ dependent) when 
adding vertex colors are called \emph{monadically stable 
(resp.\ monadically dependent)}~\cite{baldwin1985second}, hence, nowhere dense
classes are monadically stable. It is an interesting open question whether
monadically stable classes in general have low VC-density.
