% Nowhere dense classes of graphs were introduced
% by Ne\v set\v ril and Ossona de
% Mendez~\cite{nevsetvril2010first,nevsetvril2011nowhere} as a model
% for uniform sparseness of graphs. The concept of nowhere denseness
% turns out to be very robust, as witnessed by the fact that it is equivalent
% to multiple other concepts studied in different areas of mathematics.
% In this work we revisit connections between nowhere
% denseness and notions from (finite) model theory.
%
% Based on the work of Podewski and Ziegler~\cite{podewski1978stable},
% Adler and Adler~\cite{adler2014interpreting}
% proved that every nowhere dense class $\CCC$ of graphs is stable; that is,
% the ladder index of every first-order formula $\phi(\tup{x},\tup{y})$ over
% graphs from $\CCC$ is bounded by a constant depending only on $\phi$ and
% $\CCC$. The original proof of this fact is based on an infinite
% Ramsey argument that does not yield any explicit bounds on ladder indices.
We study nowhere dense classes of graphs, a introduced recently by
Ne\v set\v ril and Ossona de
 Mendez~\cite{nevsetvril2010first,nevsetvril2011nowhere}.
Firstly, we greatly improve the bounds in their proof demonstrating that 
such classes are uniformly quasi-wide. Secondly, 
we give a new combinatorial proof of the result of Adler and Adler~\cite{adler2014interpreting} stating that nowhere dense classes of graphs are stable.
In contrast to the original proof, our proof is completely finitistic and yields explicit bounds for ladder indices of
first-order formulas on nowhere dense classes of graphs.
