Based on work of Podewski and Zieger~\cite{podewski1978stable}, 
Adler and Adler~\cite{adler2014interpreting}
proved that every nowhere dense class $\CCC$ of graphs is stable, that is, 
every fixed first-order interpretation of a graph $G\in \CCC$ has 
ladder index bounded by a constant depending only on $\CCC$ and 
the interpretation. The proof of this fact is based on an infinite
Ramsey argument and explicit ladder indices were never given. 
In this work, we give a combinatorial proof of Adler and Adler's result in 
the finite and work out the explicit bounds for ladder indices arising
by first-order interpretations of nowhere dense classes of graphs. 


A class $\CCC$ of graphs if uniformly quasi-wide if there are functions 
$N:\N\times\N\rightarrow\N$ and $s:\N\rightarrow\N$ such 
that for all $G\in \CCC$ and all $r,m\in \N$, if $A\subseteq V(G)$
of size at least $N(r,m)$ then there is a set $S$ of size at most $s(r)$
such that there is a subset $B\subseteq A\setminus S$ which is
$r$-independent in $G-S$. We proved in~\cite{siebertz2016polynomial} 
that we can always choose $N(r,m)\leq m^{f(r)}$. The existence of the 
function $f(r)$ follows 
from the earlier non-constructive argument of Podewski and Ziegler. 
We give a simpler proof of our earlier result with much improved bounds 
on the function $f(r)$.

Finally, we observe that a construction of Bousquet and 
Thomasse\'e~\cite{BousquetT15} can be slightly modified to prove that 
the VC-dimension of the $r$-power graph $G^r$ of a graph $G$
with $K_t\not\minor_r G$ is bounded by $t-1$.
